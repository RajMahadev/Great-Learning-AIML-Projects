# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Projects

## 1. Applied Statistics

This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.
#### Skills and Tools : 
Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualisation, Statistical Inferences

## 2. Supervised Learning

This Project involved using classification algorithms to predict the income level of the customers based on attributes like 'sex', 'marital-status', 'age', 'occupation' etc. The classification algorithms that were used are: 
  * Naive Bayes
  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
  * Support Vector Classifier     
 And finally, a comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction.
#### Skills and Tools :
EDA and Classification Algorithms

## 3. Ensemble Techniques

This project invovled using different classification alogorithms to predict whether a customer will subscribe to term deposit or not based on leveraged customer information of bank marketing campaigns. Ensemble techniques like boosting and bagging were used to further improve the classification results. The classification algorithms that were used are:  
  * Gaussian Naive Bayes
  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree
  * K-Nearest Neighbour (kNN)
  * Support Vector Classifier
  * Random Forest Classifier
  * Bagging Classifier
  * AdaBoost Classifier
  * Gradient Boosting Classifier
  * XGBoost Classifier
  * Bagging Classifier    
 And finally, a comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction.
#### Skills and Tools :  
Classification, Decision Trees, Ensemble Techniques
